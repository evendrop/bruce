### See the demo
[bruce in action on Heroku](https://bruce-binary-game.herokuapp.com)

If the race lobby is empty, open another tab to the race lobby to simulate other lobby users.
You can also simulate a race by opening the console of the second tab and running
`ai(4000)`
This calls the ai function and passes the millisecond interval the ai solve the answers.
